This slide explains the overall process for the project with justifications for the methods used. In the beginning we investigated how Italy reduces their carbon emission compared to other countries like UK, France, Germany, China and US using the metrics renewable electricity share and emission. All date sources are from OWID who provide reliable and trustworthy dataset which are accessible to the public. We cleaned the data by filtering and renaming columns to specific years which ensures fair comparisons. We created different graphs like area chart, line chart and pie chart based on the question.

##Slide 5:
Italy’s per-capita CO₂ emissions peaked in the mid-2000s, driven mainly by electricity/heat and transport. Since then, all major sectors—especially power generation—have declined, reflecting cleaner energy, efficiency gains, and economic shifts. Transport and buildings now make up a larger share of a smaller total. The long-term downward trend highlights how policy, technology, and behavior shape national emissions. This matters for the public because meeting EU climate goals, stabilizing energy costs, and improving air quality all depend on sustaining and accelerating these sector-level transitions.

##Slide 7:
This line graph showcases the percentage of electricity produced from renewable energy sources, and is compared with the UK, Germany, France, China and US from 1990 to 2022. Italy generation of renewable electricity has increased with significant acceleration beginning of 2008. Also, Italy outperforms the US, France and China but is behind Germany and UK who show faster growth. The trends suggest all countries are committed to transitioning to renewable electricity which the graph shows meaning Italy progress towards more sustainable energy is positive.
