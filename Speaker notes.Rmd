##Slide 3:
This slide explains the overall process for the project with justifications for the methods used. In the beginning we investigated how Italy reduces their carbon emission compared to other countries like EU, China and US using the metrics renewable electricity share and emission. All date sources are from OWID who provide reliable and trustworthy dataset which are accessible to the public. We cleaned the data by filtering and renaming columns to specific years which ensures fair comparisons. We created different graphs like area chart, line chart and pie chart based on the question

##Slide 5:
Italy’s per-capita CO₂ emissions peaked in the mid-2000s, driven mainly by electricity/heat and transport. Since then, all major sectors—especially power generation—have declined, reflecting cleaner energy, efficiency gains, and economic shifts. Transport and buildings now make up a larger share of a smaller total. The long-term downward trend highlights how policy, technology, and behavior shape national emissions. This matters for the public because meeting EU climate goals, stabilizing energy costs, and improving air quality all depend on sustaining and accelerating these sector-level transitions.
##Slide 6:
This line graph shows the per capita carbon dioxide emissions from electricity and heat for Italy compared with several major countries. Italy’s emissions remained relatively moderate, and throughout the entire period, it consistently recorded lower values than  China, the European Union average, and especially the United States, which had the highest levels. Overall, Italy’s trend suggests a comparatively restrained and efficient use of carbon intensive electricity.
##Slide 7:
This line graph showcases the percentage of electricity produced from renewable energy sources. We compare this with the EU, China and US from 1990 to 2022. Italy generation of renewable electricity has increased with significant acceleration beginning from 2008. Also, Italy outperforms the US and China but is behind EU who show faster growth. The trends suggest all countries are committed to transitioning to renewable electricity which the graph shows meaning Italy progress towards more sustainable energy is positive. The visual analyses Italy’s issue of high emission to see if they are transitioning towards cleaner energy. 
##Slide 8:
In this chart, we compare Italy’s energy mix with the EU, USA, and China. Italy stands out for its very high dependence on gas, which makes energy prices and security major public concerns. At the same time, Italy shows relatively strong contributions from hydro and solar compared to other major economies, reflecting growing public support for renewables. Italy’s low use of coal and oil also highlights a cleaner fossil-fuel profile. Overall, the chart shows a country balancing current gas reliance with increasing pressure to expand sustainable energy.
