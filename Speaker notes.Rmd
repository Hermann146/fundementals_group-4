Italy’s per-capita CO₂ emissions peaked in the mid-2000s, driven mainly by electricity/heat and transport. Since then, all major sectors—especially power generation—have declined, reflecting cleaner energy, efficiency gains, and economic shifts. Transport and buildings now make up a larger share of a smaller total. The long-term downward trend highlights how policy, technology, and behavior shape national emissions. This matters for the public because meeting EU climate goals, stabilizing energy costs, and improving air quality all depend on sustaining and accelerating these sector-level transitions.
##Slide 6:
This line graph shows the per capita carbon dioxide emissions from electricity and heat for Italy compared with several major countries. Italy’s emissions remained relatively moderate, and throughout the entire period it consistently recorded lower values than Germany, the United Kingdom, China, the European Union average, and especially the United States, which had the highest levels. Only France emitted less than Italy. Overall, Italy’s trend suggests a comparatively restrained and efficient use of carbon intensive electricity.
##Slide 7:
This line graph showcases the percentage of electricity produced from renewable energy sources, and is compared with the UK, Germany, France, China and US from 1990 to 2022. Italy generation of renewable electricity has increased with significant acceleration beginning from 2008. Also, Italy outperforms the US, France and China but is behind Germany and UK who show faster growth. The trends suggest all countries are committed to transitioning to renewable electricity which the graph shows meaning Italy progress towards more sustainable energy is positive.
##Slide 8:
In 2022, Italy relied heavily on gas for its energy supply, with over half of total production from this single source. Renewables—mainly hydro and solar—played a meaningful but secondary role, while nuclear energy was not included as it contributed nothing. This reliance explains why energy prices and security remain major concerns: disruptions in gas supply quickly impact households and businesses. At the same time, the steady growth of renewables reflects strong public interest in cleaner, more reliable options. The chart shows a country dependent on Gas and proceeding towards sustainable energy.
