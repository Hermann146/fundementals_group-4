## Overview and Objectives

The objective is to assess Italy's overall discharge in CO~2~ emissions and energy use.

We compare Italy with the EU, China and the US to understand its emission patterns.

We also examine sector wise per capita emissions and the role of renewable energy over period.

Finally, we review Italy’s energy mix and environmental policies to understand its progress towards sustainability.

## Method

| Step | Process | Justification |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Research Question** | Comparison of Italy's CO2 emissions reduction using renewable electricity against global countries. | Analysis on Italy's environmental performance and global comparison. |
| **Data Sources** | Used datasets from Our World in Data (OWID). | OWID is a reliable, public, and accessible source for fair international comparison. |
| **Data Cleaning** | First we cleaned column names, filtered data to relevant countries/years, and removed N/A values. | Ensures consistency and accuracy for a fairer comparison. |
| **Visuals** | Created line graphs, an area chart, and a pie chart which highlighted Italy's data. | Visuals show trends over time using line/area charts and single-year comparisons using pie chart. |

-   Italy consistently emits less CO~2~ per capita than Germany and the wider European Union average, while remaining higher than France.
-   The United States emits nearly three times Italy’s CO~2~ per capita, but China follows an inverse trajectory, with rapid industrialization reaching almost 9 tonnes today.

-   Significant decline since then across nearly all sectors.

-   Trend reflects cleaner energy, efficiency gains, and economic shifts.

-   Italy's renewable electricity share has seen a steady growth from 1990 to 2022, with massive growth starting from 2008.

-   Italy outperforms the US and China, while the European Union shows higher renewable growth peaks in 2022.

-   Italy's progress shows commitment towards cleaner electricity usage and their transition to achieve that goal.

-   Its hydro and solar shares are comparatively strong, aligning with EU trends and reflecting public interest in cleaner, sustainable energy.

-   Italy uses much less coal and oil than the other countries, giving it a cleaner fossil-fuel profile and supporting public demand for reduced environmental impact.

-   Although Italy produces more energy from renewable sources than the US and China, and a share similar to the EU, it still relies primarily on gas for its overall energy production.

## Environmental policy

Table of Italy's Environmental Policy Comparison

| Comparative Region | Italy's Approach | Key Differences |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **European Union** | Italy aligns with EU goals (PNIEC) but resists strict EV-only mandates, favouring "tech neutrality" (biofuels). | National Flexibility vs. Bloc Targets |
| **USA** | Italy relies on Carbon Pricing and regulation ("Sticks"); the USA relies on uncapped Subsidies/IRA ("Carrots"). | Regulation vs. Incentive |
| **China** | Italy has falling emissions but slow democratic permitting whereas China has rising emissions but rapid, state-mandated infrastructure build out. | Democratic Process vs. Command & Control. |

## Conclusion

- Italy’s emissions have declined steadily across sectors, unlike the USA and China, where declines are slower or inconsistent.


- Italy’s per-capita emissions are among the lowest in its comparison group, below the EU average and far below the USA and China.


- Growth in renewable electricity is strong, outpacing the USA and China and closely tracking EU progress.


- Italy’s energy mix is cleaner than its peers due to low coal use and strong hydro/solar contributions.


- Overall: Italy is reducing emissions more sustainably and consistently than the USA and China, and broadly aligns with the EU’s trajectory—though further acceleration is needed to meet long-term climate goals.
